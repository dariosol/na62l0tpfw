Starting the repository from version 33. System works with 8 ethernet links, receiving calibration of lkr on port0 for the NIMInteface, which has been cleaned from not used procedures. Check on triggers belonging to the same timestamp performed in the trigger selection.
End of run 2018:
Choke implemented, works, but crosstalk between gtk error and gtk choke.
25 on T10: trigger oscillations: seems due to merged fifo going full.
Axions: 50% of triggers missing!!!
